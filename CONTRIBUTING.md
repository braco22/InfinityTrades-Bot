# Contributing

## Voting
Give The Repo a Star<br>
Vote for it at top.gg and other bot lists<br>
and tell your friends!

## Testing and Feedback
Write issues!<br>
Report Bugs, do Feature Requests, give Feedback etc.<br>
Try the dev branch and test everything out!<br>
Your feedback helps me improving the Bot even more!<br>
I really need ppl who test the Bot.<br>


## For Developers
You can contribute to the code. Create a Fork, make your changes and open a pull request.<br>
You can also reach me out and we can code something together.<br>
If you want to improve other things than the code (e.g. Readme) its also nice. Like before, just create a pull request and I'll look into it.
If you don't know what to code, look into Projects.


## Design
I need a Theme for ExpireBot and a Logo. You can submit your designs in #logo-submissions


## Contact
Join my Discord! https://discord.gg/ptpyaEPpapy<br>
Discuss with others about the Bot, ask questions etc.<br>
Get Involved into the Developing process!<br>
Pls don't use the issues Tab for random chatting around, use the Discussions Tab instead.<br>
If you don't have Discord or Github, you can contact me on twitter or on other social media. Note that I won't check them that often.

## Donating
Hosting a Bot is expensive. So if you donate, it really helps.<br>
You can send your donation (in XMR) to
